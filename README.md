# fadeImages
Pure JS code that fades through images like a slideshow


How to use:

Open up the script.js file and copy and paste the code into your website docs

Replace all 'bgImg' texts with the html id tag that you would like to add the fade effect to.

There are comments in the file to indicate which values to change to get the result you would like

**remember to compress your images so load time is decreased.**
